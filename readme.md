# THRUST//DOLL

> A distant future where the line between technology and biology has blurred to nonexistence. The player controls a disposable THRUST//DOLL, injected into the heart of a vast machine intelligence to destroy its core. Only their modified, superhuman body can move and react fast enough penetrate the machine’s defences. As the missions get more dangerous, it must evolve to match. But the more time it spends in this alien world, the less clear the THRUST//DOLL’s cause becomes…

A high speed 3D grappling hook game. Avoid dying, hit the machine core at high speed. Attempt to complete levels as quickly as possible.
